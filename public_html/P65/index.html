    <p class="col-md-6 offset-md-3 " style="color:   #000">Inframund Library is currently one of the oldest and most traditional bookstores in Bogotá. It was originally the Librería Jurídica, a store located on Calle 14, a company acquired in 1958 by Salomón Lerner, manager and founder of the Lerner Bookstore. Since then it has established itself as a cultural reference with emphasis on the academic and university books and has been strengthened over the years with a wide range of bibliographies in the fields of social and human sciences and Colombian books. .

      Since 1958, the Lerner Bookstore has grown to cater for Colombian readers with the widest range of books, a catalog in which about 80,000 titles can be counted in all fields of knowledge. Since the opening of the premises of Avenida Jiménez in the late sixties and that of Calle 92 in the nineties, the spaces offered by the Lerner have become centers of promotion of reading and love for the books.

      In mid-2016, the North Headquarters moved to a new location in Race 11 with 93rd Street in order to become a center that meets the cultural needs of the north of the city. In the 800 square meters of the new store, readers will find a bright and spacious children's area and a cozy Perfect Love coffee on the back terrace. This experience is complemented by the virtual store we launched in March 2017 and a new digital presence in social networks and new media to bring the books to all audiences</p>
